I'm Chris. I'm a college graduate looking to start a career in Software or Web Development! I'll be graduating from Codeup's Full-Stack Web-Development program on January 3rd

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for jobs, improving a Javascript game I started early on when I was in Codeup and also expanding on my Capstone project which is a forum inspired by topsters, for exploring and sharing one's favorite albums, and hopefully discovering new ones.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking to learn more about React
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my Project Euler problem #3 solution (it's weird and math-y)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: chris.lundblade@gmail.com 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play bass in a hardcore band
